# 3DForgeComponents
A selection of useful Unity components to use with 3D Forge buildings and blueprints. This code and associated Unity package contains components that provide useful functionality:

- **Building Door** - provides opening and closing functionality, complete with automatically generated trigger colliders and dynamic action text prompts
- **Building Lights** - provides automatic customisation of all lights within a building, including standard configuration for both Standard and HDRP Light sources. Also includes a control component to trigger "all lights on" and "all lights off" following hour passed events, such as those triggered by Enviro.

Full instructions can be found in the documentation folder within the repository, and included in the Unity Asset package.
